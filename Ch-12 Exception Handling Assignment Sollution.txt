   						Ch-12 Exception Handling  

Qn.01   Explain different types of Errors in java. 

Ans. In any programming language we categories errors into 2 types…… 
1. Syntax Error / CompileTimeMistakes  
2. Logical error / RunTimeMistakes   
Syntax error / CompileTimeMistakes 

a. It refers to the mistakes done by the programmer with respect to 
syntax.  

b. These mistakes are identified by the compiler, so we say it as 
“CompileTimeMistakes” 
 
Logical Error / RunTimeMistakes  

a. It refers to the mistakes done the programmer in terms of writing a 
logic. 

b. These mistakes are identified by JVM during the execution of a 
program, so we say it as “RunTimeMistakes”. 

Qn.02   What is an Exception in java?  

Ans. An unwanted / expected event hat disturbs the normal flow of execution of a 
program is called “Exception handling”. 
• The main objective of Exception handling is to handle the exception.  
• It is available for graceful termination of program. 

Qn.03   How can you handle exceptions in java? Explain with an example.
 
Ans. Exception handling can be performed using:  
Try:  the set of statements or code which requires monitoring for an exception 
is kept under this block. 
Catch: this block catches all exceptions that were trapped in the try block.  
Finally: this block is always performed irrespective of the catching of 
expectations in the try or catch block.

   Ex. class Launch { 
    public static void main (String args []) { 
      try { 
     System.out.println(“hello” + ““+ 1/0); 
      } 
      catch (ArithmeticException e) { 
     System.out.println(“World”); 
      } 
     } 
    } 

Qn.04   Why do we need exception handling in java? 

Ans. If there is no try and catch block while an exception occurs, the program will 
terminate. Exception handling endures the smooth running of a program without 
program termination. 

Qn.05   What is the difference between exception and error in java?
  
Ans. Errors typically happen while an application is running. For instance, out of 
memory Error occurs in case the JVM runs out of memory. On the other hand, 
exceptions are mainly caused by the application. For instance, Null Pointer 
Exceptions happens when an app tries to get through a null object.  

Qn.06   Name the different types of exceptions in java. 

Ans. Based on handling by JVM, there are typically two types of exceptions in java. 
a. Checked: Occur during the compilation. Here, the compiler checks whether 
the exception is handled and throws an error accordingly.  
b. Unchecked: Occur during program execution. These are not detectable during 
the completion process.
