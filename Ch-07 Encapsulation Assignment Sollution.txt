					Ch-07 Encapsulation  

Qn.01   What is Encapsulation in java? Why is it called Data hiding? 

Ans. Binding of data and corresponding methods into a single unit is called Encapsulation. 
In Encapsulation, a class’s variables are hidden from other classes and can only be 
accessed by the methods f class in which they are found.   

Qn.02   What are the important features of Encapsulation? 

Ans. Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so 
users cannot access static value for all the variables of a particular objects.  
Encapsulation can be used to hid both data members and data functions or methods 
associated with an instantiated class or object. 

Qn.03   What are Getter and Setter in java. Explain with an Example?   
Ans.      
Setter  
Setter methods are used to set the value to the instance variable of the class. 
Syntax…  
a. Compulsory the method name should start with set.  
b. It should be public.  
c. Return type should be void.  
d. Compulsory it should have same argument.   
Getter 
Getter methods are used to get the value form the instance variable of the class. 
Syntax… 
a. Compulsory the method name starts with get. 
b. It should be public. 
c. Return type should not be void. 
d. Compulsory it should not have any argument.  
Ex.    
class Student { 
Private Sting name; 
Private integer id; 
// Setters  
public void setName (String name) { 
this.name = name;} 
Page | 19 
Page | 20 
 
    public void setId (integer id) { 
     this.id = id;} 
     // Getters 
    public String name () { 
     return name;} 
    public integer id () { 
     return id;} 
 public class Demo { 
   public static void main (String [] args) { 
    Student st = new Student (); 
     st setName(“Arbaj”); 
   System.out.println(“name is “+ st getName); 
    } 
   } 

Qn.04   What is the use of this keyword explain with an example. 

Ans. The, this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.  
    The most common use of this keyword is to eliminate the 
confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name. (Because 
a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter.) 

Qn.05   What is the advantage of Encapsulation. 
 
 
Qn.06   How to achieve encapsulation in java? Give an example?  

Ans. We can create a fully encapsulated class in java by making all the data 
members of the class private. 
     Now we can use setter and getter methods to set 
and get the data in it. The java bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated 
class.
