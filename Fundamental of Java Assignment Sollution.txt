				Fundamental of Java 

Qn.01   What is programming language? 

Ans. A set of instructions written by a programmer to deliver instruction to the computer to 
perform and accomplish a task is called programming language.  

Qn.02   Why do we need a programming language? 

Ans. Because Computers does not understand Human language. The computers only understand 
1s and 0s so allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand and 
write. 

Qn.03   What are the features of java? 

Ans. The major features of java are…….  
1. Simple       
2. Object – Oriented 
3. Platform Independent 
4. Portable 
5. Robust 
6. Secure 
7. Interpreted  
8. Multi – Threaded    

Qn.04   What is an Object? 

Ans. An object is an entity with State and Behavior, Such as a Chair, pen, car etc. It could be

b. Behavior: represents how an object behaves (or how it functions), such as when you 
deposit or withdraw money. 
c. Identity: Usually, a distinct ID is used to implement an object's identification. The 
external user cannot see the value of the ID. However, the JVM uses it internally to 
uniquely identify each object. 

Qn.05   What is a class?
